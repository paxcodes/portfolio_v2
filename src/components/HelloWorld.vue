      I love automation because it gives people back the time they can spend to
      think deeply and creatively about solutions to big problems. I build
      <strong>CLI and web apps</strong> that integrate with APIs to automate
      onerous work prone to human errors. Outside of work, I build apps and
      their backend APIs.

    <p>I love Python and am spoiled by its clean syntax.</p>
